# Step types

Your `.wharf-ci.yml` file contains
[stages and steps](/usage/stages-and-steps.md), and each step type can be one
of our presets do compose the actions your build process needs.

To start you can look into the [container step](/usage/step-types/container.md)
that is used to run a set of commands inside an OCI (Docker) container.
