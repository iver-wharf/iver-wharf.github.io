# Problem: Error building url

<!-- panels:start -->

<!-- div:right-panel -->

- Title: `Error building url.`
- Type: `/prob/provider/azuredevops/building-url-error`

<!-- div:left-panel -->

Unable to build url.

<!-- panels:end -->

## Possible causes

<!-- panels:start -->

<!-- div:left-panel -->

A malformed url may cause this error to occur.

Note that trying to parse a hostname and path
without a scheme is invalid but may not necessarily cause this
error, due to parsing ambiguities.

## Resolving it

If you cannot resolve it yourself using the error message, try to contact your
administrator / operations team that manages your Wharf instance.

If that fails, try promoting the issue over to the Wharf developers over at
GitHub as an issue: <https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-provider-azuredevops/issues/new>
