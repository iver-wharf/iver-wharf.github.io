## Resolving it

Make sure the group you provided exists.

If you cannot resolve it yourself using the error message, try to contact your
administrator / operations team that manages your Wharf instance.

If that fails, try promoting the issue over to the Wharf developers over at
GitHub as an issue: <https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-provider-gitlab/issues/new>
