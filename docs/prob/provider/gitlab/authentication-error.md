# Problem: Error authenticating

<!-- panels:start -->

<!-- div:right-panel -->

- Title: `Error authenticating.`
- Type: `/prob/provider/gitlab/authentication-error`

<!-- div:left-panel -->

An error occurred when trying to authenticate.

<!-- panels:end -->

## Possible causes

<!-- panels:start -->

- Invalid token.
- The provided token does not have the required permissions.

<!-- panels:end -->

## Resolving it

Make sure a valid token has been provided, and that it has
the required permissions.

If you cannot resolve it yourself using the error message, try to contact your
administrator / operations team that manages your Wharf instance.

If that fails, try promoting the issue over to the Wharf developers over at
GitHub as an issue: <https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-provider-gitlab/issues/new>
