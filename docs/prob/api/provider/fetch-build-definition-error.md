# Problem: Error fetching build definition

<!-- panels:start -->

<!-- div:right-panel -->

- Title: `Error fetching build definition.`
- Type: `/prob/provider/fetch-build-definition`

<!-- div:left-panel -->

The provider plugin failed to fetch the build definition from the remote
provider.

<!-- panels:end -->

## Possible causes

- The request to the remote provider might have been malformed.
- BasicAuth might have been invalid.

## Resolving it

If you cannot resolve it yourself using the error message, try to contact your
administrator / operations team that manages your Wharf instance.

If that fails, try promoting the issue over to the Wharf developers over at
GitHub as an issue: <https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/issues/new>
