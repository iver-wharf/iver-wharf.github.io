## Possible causes

- Missing credentials.
- Invalid credentials, e.g. `token`, `username`, `password`.
- Insufficient permissions to perform the requested operation.

## Resolving it

Verify your credentials and their permissions.

If you cannot resolve it yourself using the error message, try to contact your
administrator / operations team that manages your Wharf instance.

If that fails, try promoting the issue over to the Wharf developers over at
GitHub as an issue: <https://github.com/iver-wharf/wharf-api/issues/new>
